/**
 * Scoped ticket — single-use, short-lived authorization for ONE transfer.
 *
 * The transfer origin is a different origin, which is the point (see
 * `transfer-origin.ts`), but it also means the control plane's session cookie
 * does not travel there.  That is a feature: a long-lived ambient credential
 * on a bulk endpoint is exactly the thing you do not want reachable from a
 * relayed customer-VPC connector.  Instead the CONTROL plane mints a narrow
 * ticket and the browser redeems it once, at the transfer origin.
 *
 * The scope is deliberately narrow on four axes at once — subject, operation,
 * lifetime, and use count — because a ticket that is broad on any ONE of them
 * stops being meaningfully different from a session token.
 *
 * This module is the client-side custodian: it tracks redemption locally so a
 * retry cannot silently replay a spent ticket. It is NOT the security boundary
 * — the transfer origin re-validates every ticket server-side and is the only
 * authority that may accept one. A client-side check that a server does not
 * repeat is a UX affordance, and treating it as enforcement is how single-use
 * quietly becomes multi-use.
