/**
 * query-fetcher — ONE `GET /rest-query` per sync query, through a bounded gate.
 *
 * Replaced the micro-batcher on 2026-07-26 (drop-sync-batcher-2026-07-25). The
 * batcher coalesced a refetch wave into one `POST /rest-query-batch`; the
 * server resolved that bundle with `Promise.all` and answered only when its
 * SLOWEST member did, so every panel in the wave waited on the worst query in
 * it. That head-of-line coupling is structural — a bundle is indivisible, so no
 * window size could have fixed it — and it is the reason this module exists.
 *
 * The SIZE of the win is transport-dependent, so quote the right number. On the
 * DESKTOP path (webview→sidecar IPC, the one that ships) a 106-query wave costs
 * about the same either way — 2922ms individual at the default gate vs 3000ms
 * bundled — but individual requests paint continuously (p50 395ms) instead of
 * showing nothing until the wall, a ~7.6x better time-to-first-paint at equal
 * total cost. Planning's loopback-HTTP numbers against :3070 (bundle 2676ms vs
 * 1126ms individual) showed a far larger wall win; those do NOT transfer to IPC
 * and must not be used to retune anything — see plan D-003 and the note on
 * `DEFAULT_MAX_IN_FLIGHT` below.
 *
 * What this module keeps from the batcher, deliberately:
 *   - the rows-delta codec round-trip, now per REQUEST rather than per batch
 *     slot (`delta=<cursor>`, `delta=` to opt in cold, refetch-full on a
 *     checksum mismatch — correctness still rides the codec's checksum guard);
 *   - `reportSyncReachable` / `reportSyncUnreachable` connectivity signalling;
 *   - the `{ rows, version }` result shape its callers destructure.
 *
 * What it adds back: per-query `AbortSignal` cancellation, which a bundle
 * structurally could not offer (it is indivisible). An unmounted panel now
 * cancels its in-flight request instead of leaving the server to resolve a
 * query nobody will read — worth having when a wave is ~6MB.
 *
 * NOTE ON `GET`: args ride the query string. Every live sync query's args are
 * small ids/limits, well inside header limits; a resolver that ever needs a
 * large argument object should take a name + a server-side id, not a fatter URL.

 * this against `:3070` over plain loopback HTTP and found wall time FLAT from
 * concurrency 6 to 24 (1126ms vs 1106ms), which said "pick the low end, it is
 * free, and per-query latency is better there". Re-measured inside a running
 * Tauri shell over the real webview→sidecar IPC path — 106 live sync queries,
 * warmed, 5 interleaved rounds — wall is NOT flat (median ms):
 *
 *     conc=12   4981      p50 212      <- SLOWER than the bundle it replaces
 *     conc=16   3732      p50 307
 *     conc=24   2922      p50 395      <- chosen
 *     one bundle 3000     nothing paints before the wall
 *
 * At 24 the wave finishes as fast as the bundle (2922 vs 3000) AND half the
 * panels have painted by ~395ms instead of every panel waiting ~3000ms — a
 * ~7.6x better time-to-first-paint at equal total cost. At 12 the wall
 * REGRESSES past the bundle, which is the one outcome that would have made
 * dropping the batcher a net loss.
 *
 * The trade is real and deliberate: raising the cap raises per-query p50
 * (212 → 395ms) because parallel resolvers contend for the same PG pool and
 * event loop. It is worth it because the bundle's effective p50 IS its wall.
 *
 * Do not "restore" a lower default from the planning numbers without
 * re-measuring over IPC; loopback-HTTP results do not transfer (plan D-003).
 * The floor still matters for a different reason: on the two paths with a real
 * per-host connection cap (the desktop's pre-`PAPERCUSP_IPC_READY` HTTP
 * fallback and the `:3055` dev browser) the browser grants ~6, and a wave of
 * 106 measured 10.7-11.7s there versus 2-3s over IPC — the gate is what keeps
 * that from starving every other request on the page.

 * disabled the provider correctly capped this gate to
 * `CONNECTION_CAPPED_MAX_IN_FLIGHT`, and `fetchSyncQuery` (the dock's imperative
