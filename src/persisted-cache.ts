/**
 * Persisted sync cache (WI-3318) — app-wide stale-while-revalidate across
 * reloads. Snapshots the sync QueryClient's successful queries to
 * `localStorage` (debounced, size-capped) and hydrates them back BEFORE the
 * first component mounts, so a reload paints every panel from disk instantly
 * while the normal staleTime/SSE-invalidate machinery revalidates in the
 * background.
 *
 * Hand-rolled on react-query's own `dehydrate`/`hydrate` instead of
 * `@tanstack/react-query-persist-client`: the QueryClient here is a lib
 * singleton (SSEAdapter mounts its own `QueryClientProvider` around
 * `getQueryClient()` — there is no app-level provider to wrap in a
 * `PersistQueryClientProvider`), restore must be SYNCHRONOUS to beat the
 * first `useQuery` mount, and no new dependency is needed.
 *
 * Opt-in: nothing here runs unless the HOST APP calls
 * `enablePersistedSyncCache()` at module-eval time (the same
 * before-any-component-mounts slot the desktop IPC polyfills use — see
 * apps/operator RootSyncProvider). Other consumers of @papercusp/sync are
 * untouched.
 *
 * Failure posture: best-effort cache. Every storage/parse failure degrades to
 * "no persisted cache" (bad entries are removed), never to a thrown error on
 * the boot path.
